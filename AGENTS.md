# En Escena — guide for coding agents

Routes to the repo's conventions; each rule lives in the file a route names. The
first section applies to every task; a line in the second applies when its
leading word matches the task.

Claude Code and Codex share this file, the skills in `.agents/skills/` and the hooks
in `.agents/hooks/` ([agent-configuration.md](docs/agents/agent-configuration.md)). In
Codex, "call the Skill tool with X" means open `.agents/skills/X/SKILL.md` and follow it.

## Every task

- **Session conduct**: when a step needs no input from the user, keep going, and put
  status notes in the same message as the next action. Stop and ask only when the work
  cannot continue without them, or before anything destructive: deleting data,
  force-pushing, changing anything outside this repository. When a rule in these docs
  fights the task, say so and get a sign-off before breaking it. End a run with what
  needs the user first, then what changed, then what was found in this run.
- **Implementing** (a feature, a fix, any code change): call the Skill tool with
  "implement" before editing. Where work starts, investigating before editing, and the
  thread's branch and worktree: [workflows.md](docs/agents/workflows.md).
- **Validation**: [validation.md](docs/agents/validation.md) is the whole surface; check
  [scripts.md](docs/operations/scripts.md) before running a command it does not list.
- **Subagents**: reviewers spawn as "Spawning a reviewer" in the `code-review` skill says,
  research as [agent-configuration.md](docs/agents/agent-configuration.md#delegating-to-subagents) says.
- **Coding standards**: [coding-standards.md](docs/agents/coding-standards.md); Spanish for
  what the user reads, English for everything else, with identifiers mapped to UI terms in
  [GLOSSARY.md](GLOSSARY.md).

## When routed

- **Commands**: [scripts.md](docs/operations/scripts.md) indexes every `pnpm` script; read
  the runbook of a ⚠️ row first. "Refresh the local db" is `pnpm db:refresh:prod`, which
  replaces the **development** database; `pnpm db:test:reset` is the **test** database.
- **Code placement**, **routes and layouts**: [codebase-map.md](docs/agents/codebase-map.md).
- **Documentation**, **UI verification**: [workflows.md](docs/agents/workflows.md).
- **Style guide** (frontend/UI): [style-guide.md](docs/agents/style-guide.md).
- **shadcn/ui** (before re-adding a component the CLI would overwrite):
  [shadcn.md](docs/agents/shadcn.md).
- **Form feedback and redirection**: [form-feedback.md](docs/agents/form-feedback.md).
- **Pull requests**: [pull-requests.md](docs/agents/pull-requests.md).
- **Issues**, **PRDs**: [issue-tracker.md](docs/agents/issue-tracker.md);
  **triage labels**: [triage-labels.md](docs/agents/triage-labels.md).
- **Domain docs**: [domain.md](docs/agents/domain.md).
- **CI**, **dependencies**: [ci.md](docs/operations/ci.md).
- **Agent configuration** (skills, hooks, subagent wiring):
  [agent-configuration.md](docs/agents/agent-configuration.md).
- **Local database and auth**: [local-auth.md](docs/local-auth.md).
- **Production infrastructure**: [infrastructure.md](docs/operations/infrastructure.md).
- **Staging** (`pruebas.enescena.com.ar`): [staging.md](docs/operations/staging.md).
- **DNS and email**: [dns-and-email.md](docs/operations/dns-and-email.md).
- **Fallow**: [fallow.md](docs/agents/fallow.md).
- **Architecture Review** runner: [afk-setup.md](docs/agents/afk-setup.md).
- **Upstream skills**: [vendored-skills.md](docs/agents/vendored-skills.md).
