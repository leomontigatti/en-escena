/**
 * Lints the migrations a branch *adds* with squawk, and splits what it reports
 * into a tier that fails the branch and a tier that only reports. Which rule
 * lands where, and why, is explained once in scripts/migrations/squawk.mjs.
 *
 * Only added files are linted, so an applied migration is never re-judged: a
 * rule squawk gains later cannot retroactively fail a branch that did not touch
 * the file, and a `-- squawk-ignore` written before merge stays the permanent
 * record of the exception, frozen by check-migration-immutability.mjs.
 *
 * Runs in CI and locally, so the GitHub Actions annotation prefixes are only
 * emitted under Actions, where they mean something.
 *
 * Usage: node scripts/check-migration-safety.mjs [base-ref]
