 * advisory both sides carry is inherited from `master`, and failing on it
 * would turn every open PR red the day a CVE is disclosed against a dependency
 * nobody on that branch touched, AFK branches included. Dependabot alerts
 * cover the full tree for that case; this gate covers the delta.
 *
 * Advisories are keyed by GHSA id rather than by pnpm's numeric `id`: the GHSA
 * is the identifier the advisory is published under, the one an ignore entry is
 * written against, and the one a human can look up.
