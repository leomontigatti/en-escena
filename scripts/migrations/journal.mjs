/**
 * Pure reasoning about the Drizzle migration journal, shared by the container
 * entrypoint (scripts/migrate.mjs) and the CI ordering check
 * (scripts/check-migration-order.mjs).
 *
 * This module is the single home for the reasoning; the entrypoint, the CI
 * check and the workflow step point here instead of restating it.
 *
 * `drizzle-orm` tracks applied migrations with a high-water mark rather than
 * set membership: `pg-core/dialect.js` reads `order by created_at desc limit 1`
 * and then applies every migration whose `when` is *strictly greater*. Three
 * consequences, and every check below follows from one of them:
 *
 * 1. A migration merged with a timestamp at or below the watermark is skipped
 *    permanently, and silently. `findOutOfOrderEntries` catches that in review,
 *    `findJournalInconsistencies` at container start.
 * 2. The stored `hash` is written but never read back, so a `.sql` file edited
 *    after being applied goes unnoticed. `findJournalInconsistencies` reads it.
 * 3. The watermark is read *outside* the transaction that then applies the
 *    migrations, so overlapping starts act on the same stale read — which is
 *    why `scripts/migrate.mjs` holds an advisory lock across both.
 *
 * The human-facing version of all this lives in docs/db/migrations.md.
