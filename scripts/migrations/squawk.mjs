/**
 * Pure reasoning about a squawk run over newly added migrations, shared by
 * scripts/check-migration-safety.mjs and its tests.
 *
 * squawk lints a migration's SQL for two unrelated hazards, and this repo
 * cares about them at different strengths:
 *
 * 1. **Compatibility with the code still running.** Coolify keeps the old
 *    container serving while the new one migrates, so a dropped or renamed
 *    object breaks the old code's queries for the length of the deploy. An
 *    identifier over 63 characters is the same class of break: Postgres
 *    truncates it silently, so the object no longer answers to the name
 *    `schema.ts` uses. Those findings block.
 * 2. **Lock hazards.** A table scan or an exclusive lock taken while writes
 *    queue behind it. Harmless at this repo's table sizes and expensive at
 *    scale, so they are reported and merge anyway.
 *
 * Everything squawk reports that is not in `blockingRules` falls in the second
 * tier by construction, so a rule added by a later squawk release warns rather
 * than blocking a branch that never asked for it.
 *
 * The human-facing version of all this lives in docs/db/migrations.md.
 *
 * @typedef {{ file: string; line: number; column: number; level: string; message: string; help: string | null; rule_name: string }} SquawkFinding
