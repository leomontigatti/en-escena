/**
 * Fails a branch on the high and critical advisories it *introduces*, by
 * auditing its tree and the base ref's and reporting the difference.
 *
 * Why the difference and not the whole tree is explained once, in
 * scripts/dependencies/audit.mjs, next to the comparison it justifies. This
 * file is the I/O half: where the two trees come from and how a failure reads.
 *
 * Neither run installs anything: `pnpm audit` resolves the tree from the
 * lockfile and asks the registry, so the base side is just the base ref's
 * `package.json`, `pnpm-lock.yaml` and `pnpm-workspace.yaml` in a temp
 * directory (~1 s a run). Carrying `pnpm-workspace.yaml` across is also what
 * makes the accepted-advisory list apply to both sides: an entry added there
 * suppresses the advisory on the head and the base alike, so accepting one
 * never reads as "the branch fixed it".
 *
 * Runs in CI and locally, so the GitHub Actions annotation prefixes are only
 * emitted under Actions, where they mean something.
 *
 * Usage: node scripts/check-dependency-audit.mjs [base-ref]
