# Production infrastructure

What runs in production, as current state. The reasoning behind this shape — why
none of it is Supabase anymore — is in
[ADR-0013](../adr/0013-exit-supabase.md); this page does not repeat it.

Everything is co-located in `sa-east` (São Paulo), which is the constraint
ADR-0013 records.

## Host and application

- **VPS**: Hostinger, `72.60.59.2`, reachable as `rylai` over SSH. Its firewall
  is default-deny; see [DNS and email](./dns-and-email.md) for the Cloudflare-only
  `443` rules.
- **Platform**: Coolify.
- **Application**: Coolify resource `x1383fsxfsixpgmvd9quv7tj`, served at
  `sistema.enescena.com.ar`.
- Migrations run from the container entrypoint before the app serves, so a
  failed migration is a container that will not start. See
  [Database migrations](../db/migrations.md).

## Database

- Coolify-managed Postgres, image `postgres:17-alpine`, co-located with the app
  on the same VPS (#267) — app↔database latency is loopback.
- Database name: `enescena`. Every schema lives in it, including `public` and
  `drizzle`.
- `is_public: false`, with **no published port**: there is no route from a
  laptop. Reach it with `ssh rylai` and `docker exec`, not a tunnel.
- No connection pooling: Coolify ships no native pgBouncer, and one gets mounted
  separately only if peak load demands it.
- Backups are configured on the Postgres resource itself, not in this repo. See
  [Backups](./backups.md).

## Storage

- The live byte store is a persistent Coolify volume on the VPS, at
  `STORAGE_VOLUME_DIR` (`/var/lib/en-escena/storage` in production), since #399.
- Bucket directories under it keep the original object keys
  (`academies/...`), so the layout is identical to what B2 held.
- Backblaze B2 is a **backup destination only**. It is not the live store.
- `createSignedUrl` is not an S3 presign: it is a short-lived authenticated
  route that serves the byte from the volume. Nothing is lost to caching,
  because the edge must not cache PII in the first place.
- Dancer documents on this volume are plaintext PII; encryption at rest is
  accepted debt, documented in [Backups](./backups.md#encryption-at-rest-accepted-debt).

### Choreography music contract

Bucket, formats, size limit and expiry are enforced in
`app/lib/storage/choreography-music.server.ts`; the replacement ordering is
enforced by its caller, `app/lib/portal/choreography-music.server.ts`. Rehomed
here from ADR-0010, which stated the contract against a Supabase bucket that no
longer exists.

- Bucket directory: `en-escena-choreography-music`, private.
- The `Coreografia` row stores only the current storage key, never a URL.
- Accepted formats: MP3, M4A/AAC, WAV and OGG, up to **50 MB**. The limit is a
  product choice about upload sizes, not a plan ceiling.
- Downloads go through a signed URL that expires after **300** seconds.
- Replacement uploads the new object **before** deleting the previous one, so a
  failed upload leaves the existing music intact.
- The row is updated **before** the previous object is deleted, so a failed
  delete leaves that object orphaned on the volume. The replacement still
  succeeds — the academy is not told a save failed when it did not — and the
  orphan is logged as `[storage:music:orphan]` with the key. There is no sweep
  that reclaims it: reconciliation is by hand, from that log line. The
  divergence from dancer documents (`adapter.remove` there propagates) is
  deliberate: that delete happens before the row is written, so failing it
  costs nothing.
